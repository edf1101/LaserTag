# /arduino_builds
This directory contains the Arduino builds for the project.

The build is the 'LaserTag' folder. This must be copied into the Arduino IDE's main folder (usually in /documents)

### Common arduino IDE compilation errors:

- DO NOT Remove LaserTag.ino from this 'arduino_builds' folder. It is required for the compilation of builds to work.
- Must use relative addresses ie ```/../Display``` etc.
