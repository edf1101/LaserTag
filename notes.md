# Notes

_Notes about the project / ideas_

- Anticheat (If everyone doesn't have a certain weapon then it can't be used)
- System to check no overlapping unitnums, else it will be modified.
- FastLED stuff
- Optional Vibration motors
- Have a define to turn on or off Serial debug
- Anticheat could work by making a hash of all the weapons and checking if each gun has the same total weapon hash.
- Would be nice if beacon code was in this same repository and you just changed a define 
at the top of the file to switch between the two.
- Same with test mode except it could be hold down trigger instead of define.
- Latch circuit to turn on the gun and timer / menu to turn off the gun
- Bump the bottom of the gun twice to reload magazine.
