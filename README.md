# LaserTag

## Introduction
This contains all the files needed to build (both physically and in code) my laser tag system.
The system is designed to be uploaded easily with [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/) compatible builds and coded 
in a [platformio](https://platformio.org/) environment.

## Hardware
The main driver is an ESP32 at the moment.
Other components can be found:

## Software
### Libraries needed
- Adafruit Neopixel
- Adafruit SSD1306
- Adafruit ST7735
- XT_DAC_Audio

### Installation
#### Basic Setup (Arduino IDE)
To upload the code without doing any major modifications it is easiest to use the Arduino IDE:
1. Install the Arduino IDE and ESP32 board manager.
2. Download the simple code from the releases section.
3. Open the code in the Arduino IDE.
4. Select the correct board and port.
5. Upload the code.

#### Advanced Setup (Platformio)
To use the code in a platformio environment:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the code in a platformio environment.
3. Build and upload the code.
